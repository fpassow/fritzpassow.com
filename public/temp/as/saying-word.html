          <blockquote>&quot;Audrey&apos;s dynamic personality and method engaged our college students, got them
           interested in examining their own effectiveness and how to work at improving their 
           proclamation.&quot;

            <blockquote>&quot;I&nbsp;experienced this type of technique a number of years ago when the
            archdiocese had a similar program. We are seeing results with our 
            people, because when they see themselves on camera, they become 
            their own best critic. They saw their weak points, and worked on them. 
            Another important point is that you could see they really enjoyed the 
            class.&quot;

          <blockquote>&quot;The practice sessions before the video taping were very beneficial to me.  I got a better understanding of 
          how we lectors can color and emphasize certain words to give meaning to the readings.&quot;

          <blockquote>&quot;I can see a marked difference in our lectors&apos; delivery.  Their  proclamation is more
           effective and better understood by our parishioners.  Audrey got them fired up.&quot;

          <blockquote>&quot;I learned the importance of pauses and proper breathing.  In the video playbacks, I saw that I needed more
