            <h3>Livonia woman&apos;s award-winning show airs on Catholic television (July 1, 2012)</h3>
            
            <p class="pub-info">by: Sharon Dargay  (O&amp;E Staff Writer)</p>
            <p class="pub-info">Published Sunday, July 1, 2012 in the
              Livonia Observer and in neighboring suburban editions.</p>


            <h4>Audrey Sommers has made a career out of kindness</h4>

<p>When the Livonia woman found a tattered monarch butterfly at a beach, she took it home in a shoebox, 
nursed it with 
sugar water and gave it shelter in her garden. And, with the help of a heat lamp and fresh flowers, 
she extended “Howie” 
the butterfly's life some three months.</p>

<p>She recently turned the experience into a children's book and is working with a publisher toward 
an autumn release.
When Sommers, a lifelong Catholic, noticed several years ago that some lectors spoke in monotone
 at Mass, she 
created a training program to help laypersons improve their lackluster delivery.</p>

<p>Today, as the lector trainer for the Archdiocese of Detroit, she speaks at churches across the country
 and is a lector 
at St. Colette in Livonia. Her DVD, Lector and Gospel Reader's Workshop: A Resource for Bringing God's Word to Life, 
won a Telly award and is sold world-wide.</p>

<p>When Sommers, a former Channel 50 anchorwoman, heard about the Salter family of Dearborn, she knew
 their story 
would inspire others. She and a video crew spent hours with Mike and Ellen Salter and their
 children — including 
daughter, Meghan, who requires 24-hour care. The show forms the pilot of what Sommers hopes will
 become a television 
series about maintaining faith through trials and tribulations.</p>

<p>Stories of Faith - Meghan's Miracle, was broadcast on CTND — the Archdiocese cable station — and EWTN earlier 
this year. Sommers also earned an Emmy Award from the National Chapter of Television Arts and Sciences - Michigan 
Chapter, for the show. The 34th Annual Michigan Emmy Awards was held last month at the Motor City Casino 
Soundboard Theatre.</p>

<p>&quot;Tears came to my eyes,&quot; Sommers recalled, adding that while accepting the award she also said,
   &quot;Thank you God. 
This one is for you.&quot; &quot;Looking at this huge audience of peers I said, 
&lsquo;I've got to thank him first. After all, this is the religion 
category.&rsquo;&quot;
                                   <h4>Making a difference</h4>

<p>Sommers, a former writer for the Michigan Catholic and Catholic Television, 
  said she didn't start winning awards until 
she traded secular work for faith-based reporting.
She worked in secular broadcast news in both Michigan and Massachusetts, 
sometimes reporting what she calls &quot;crime and slime&quot; stories.

<p>&quot;I think I got tired of covering crime stories. I wanted to make a difference in people&apos;s lives.&quot;
She won two bronze Telly awards for Angels in the Caribbean, a television special that generated thousands of dollars 
for Food for the Poor. Her two-part print series, Angels in the Caribbean, also received honors from the Society of 
Professional Journalists and earned a Herald Award.</p>

<p>The Redford Thurston High School graduate has taught broadcast classes at Madonna University and is a long-time 
volunteer model for Redford Suburban League's annual fashion show. She and her husband keep ducks at home as 
pets and Sommers enjoys thinking up new projects while riding her bike through the neighborhood.
She's seeking a sponsor for Stories of Faith and also hopes to find a secular network to run the series that
 would focus 
on &quot;people of all faiths and religious denominations&quot; telling their stories.</p>

<p>Although Meghan&apos;s Miracle, the pilot for the show, focuses on a Catholic family,
 Sommers said it's not aimed at a 
Catholic-only audience. &quot;When you look at it, you might say, if a family can stick together through 
something like this, 
anything is possible.&quot;</p>
                                        <h4>Loving, living</h4>

<p>Meghan was just a few months old when she experienced a series of life-threatening seizures. At one point,
   the parish 
priest was called to administer Last Rites, but when he did, the seizures stopped. For the subsequent eight years, 
Meghan has remained mostly unresponsive and in need of 24-hour care.
&quot;I was amazed at the family&amp;s joy. The mom is always smiling. There is so much love from this family.
 They paint her 
(Meghan&amp;s) fingernails. They fight to be with her. A lot of times she is just lying there. 
She might have a little smile now 
and then, but the whole family exhibits joy.</p>

<p>&quot;At one point the medical profession told them maybe they should pull the plug . . . they followed the
 teaching of the 
Catholic Church to do what is right,&quot; Sommers said. &quot;The family is a shining example of togetherness
 and love.&quot;</p>

<p>Sommers will accept story ideas for her television faith series at sommersproductions@yahoo.com. Or visit 
www.lectortraining.com.
&quot;I&apos;m open to ideas. But you can&apos;t be something that&apos;s not shootable. 
You have to think of video.&quot;
See the pilot show at 2:30 p.m. Monday, July 2; 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 3 and Monday, 
July 9; 11 a.m., Thursday, July 5; 
2 p.m. Tuesday, July 10; and 10 a.m. Thursday, July 12 on CTND.</p>
